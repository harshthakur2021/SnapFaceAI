# SnapFaceAI Using React.js and TensorFlow.js

SnapFaceAI is an advanced web application built using React.js and TensorFlow.js that enables real-time facial landmark detection and manipulation. This project aims to provide users with a fun and interactive platform to explore facial recognition technology, apply filters, and experiment with AI-driven facial transformations directly in their web browsers.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Facial Landmark Detection

1. **Facial Recognition:**
   - Utilizes TensorFlow.js models to detect key facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline in real time.
   - Employs pre-trained deep learning models for accurate and efficient facial feature detection.

2. **Interactive User Interface:**
   - **Live Camera Feed:** Users can use their webcam to capture live video feeds for real-time facial analysis.
   - **Responsive Design:** The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless experience across platforms.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

1. **React.js:** For building the dynamic and interactive user interface.
2. **TensorFlow.js:** For client-side machine learning and real-time facial landmark detection.
3. **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the application.

## Installation
